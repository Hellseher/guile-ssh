;;; channel-leak.scm -- Check if libssh channels are not freed corretly.
;;
;; This test checks if the channel are properly freed; otherwise the OpenSSH
;; server will report "no more sessions" error when the maximum number of
;; sessions per a TCP connection (as specified by "MaxSessions" option) is
;; exhausted.

;; Reported by Andrew Tropin <andrew@trop.in> in
